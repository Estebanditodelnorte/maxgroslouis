    <h1>Respecting your privacy and safeguarding shared stories.</h1>
    <p class="smallprint">Last updated: {lastUpdated}</p>
    <p>
      Welcome to maxgroslouis.com (the “Site”). We are committed to protecting your personal information in accordance with Quebec’s Law 25 (where applicable)
      and internationally recognized data-protection best practices. By using this Site, you consent to the practices described below.
    </p>

    <h2>1. Collection of Personal Information</h2>
    <p>
      We collect personal details you voluntarily provide—such as your name, email, phone number, or organization—when you interact with the Site.
      Typical examples include filling out contact forms, booking visits, purchasing memberships, or subscribing to updates.
    </p>

    <h2>2. Use of Personal Information</h2>
    <p>We use your information to:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Respond to inquiries, visit requests, and service needs.</li>
      <li>Customize your experience across the Site.</li>
      <li>Deliver information about programs, products, or services you have requested or purchased.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>3. Sharing of Personal Information</h2>
    <p>We share your information only when:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>It is necessary to provide the requested service (e.g., with vetted service providers).</li>
      <li>Required by law, regulation, or court order.</li>
      <li>You have given explicit consent for the sharing.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>4. Data Security</h2>
    <p>
      We take reasonable measures to protect your information against loss, unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, or destruction.
      For example:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Secure storage:</strong> Data is stored on protected servers with physical and electronic safeguards. Access is limited to authorized personnel and
        trusted providers who require it to perform their duties.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Encryption:</strong> Personal information transmitted through the Site is encrypted using industry-standard protocols (e.g., SSL/TLS).
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      While we strive to safeguard your data, no method of transmission or storage is entirely secure. We encourage you to take steps to protect your personal information as well.
    </p>

    <h2>5. Retention of Personal Information</h2>
    <p>
      We retain your information only for as long as necessary to fulfill the purposes for which it was collected and to meet legal requirements.
      For example, booking or transaction records (name, contact details, order history) may be stored for up to five (5) years after fulfillment to support follow-up service,
      warranties, and accounting obligations. Retention periods vary depending on data type and legal context; we do not keep data longer than needed.
    </p>

    <h2>6. Your Rights</h2>
    <p>
      You may request access to, correction of, deletion of, or portability of your personal information. You may also withdraw consent where applicable.

    </p>

    <h2>7. Changes to this Policy</h2>
