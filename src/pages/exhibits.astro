        The Espace One Onti Max Gros-Louis invites visitors to explore the living memory of the Grand Chief and the Wendat Nation.
        Our exhibitions bridge historical archives, oral traditions, and contemporary creation, presenting Wendat culture as both ancestral and
        evolving. Each exhibition is co-curated with Elders and community partners to ensure authenticity, respect, and reconciliation.
